								<p class="ident-bot-2">A visit to the hospital can be frightening for most children. Since children often wonder what to expect, going on a tour is an easy way to prepare children for having surgery. EOSC's Tours for Tots is an excellent way to reassure your child and relieve much of their anxiety before their upcoming surgery.</p>
