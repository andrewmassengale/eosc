							<div class="line ident-bot-11"></div>
							<p class="ident-bot-5">CareWire is a mobile messaging service which provides you with important reminders regarding your upcoming procedure.  Messages include reminders on how to prepare, what to bring, and when to arrive. After the procedure, CareWire will ask you to simply rate your care on a scale of 0-10. <b>Patients ages 0-15 and 18-69 are automatically enrolled in CareWire if a mobile phone number was provided to EOSC by the patient or the patient’s physician.</b>  None of your personal or medical information will be sent in these messages. You will not be asked to provide any personal information for this service.</p>
							<p class="ident-bot-1"><strong>Are appointment reminders allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule without authorizations?</strong></p>
							<p>Yes, according to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, appointment reminders are considered part of treatment of an individual and, therefore, can be made without an authorization.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>How do I unsubscribe from CareWire?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>To opt-out from CareWire mobile messaging service, you can text <b>&quot;STOP&quot;</b> to <b>66746</b> from your mobile phone and we will unsubscribe you immediately. You will not receive any additional messages. You may re-register by texting <b>&quot;CAREWIRE&quot;</b> to <b>66746</b>.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Is there a cost for using CareWire?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>CareWire uses SMS (short messaging service) to deliver messages over mobile networks.  </p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>How can I get help?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>For help, text <b>&quot;HELP&quot;</b> to <b>66746</b>.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Can I send Mobile messages regarding my care with this service?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>There may be some questions that will require a response, however, your reply is voluntary.  Only those messages requiring a response will be seen by EOSC.  Please do not initiate messages to EOSC or include any personal/medical information in your response.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>How safe are these messages? Am I at a risk of receiving any virus?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The messages you will receive from this service are secure and will not transmit any type of virus.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>Who do I contact if I experience duplicate messages or error messages on my phone?</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Occasionally the mobile phone provider mistakenly sends the same message more than once.  An error message saying “Memory Full” may be corrected by deleting old messages (although once deleted, these messages cannot be retrieved).  If you are unable to trouble shoot these issues on your own or receive multiple duplicate messages or incomplete messages you should contact your mobile phone provider.</p>
