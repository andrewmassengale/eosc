									<p><strong>Communication with Medical Staff <br/> &amp; Identification of Surgery Site</strong></p>
								</div>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">For your safety, our staff will ask you to confirm your name, birth date and procedure, including the specific side of the body you are to be operated on.  This will occur with each staff member that you encounter and is part of our patient identification process. This process is also in compliance with The Joint Commission’s National Patient Safety Goals. </p>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">Your surgeon and anesthesiologist will meet with you prior to surgery to review any questions that you may have.  In addition, your surgeon will mark the surgical site. If a parent, legal guardian or family member is present, they may confirm that the correct body part is being marked.</p>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">After your procedure, our staff will speak to you regarding steps you can take to help prevent post-surgical infections. We will also provide you with a brochure that you can take home in case you have any questions after you have been discharged.</p>
								<p><strong>Patient Satisfaction</strong></p>
								<br>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">You may receive a mobile message asking you to rate your overall experience at EOSC after your procedure. If you opted not to participate in our mobile messaging service, you will receive a paper Patient Satisfaction Survey to complete or you may complete a survey on the One Medical Passport website. We strongly encourage you to complete our survey as your comments and suggestions are what assist us in creating a healthy, positive experience for all of our patients and their families.</p>
							  	<p class="ident-bot-2">To complete our survey online, please select the link below and   have your surgery date available:</p>
