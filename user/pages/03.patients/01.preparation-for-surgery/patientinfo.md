									<p><strong>Pre-Admission Process <br/> &amp; Mobile Message Reminders</strong></p>
								</div>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">Your surgeon will discuss your surgery with you during your office visit and will explain the benefits, risks and alternatives involved with your particular procedure.  Once the decision for surgery has been made, your surgeon will send EOSC a Surgery Scheduling Form so that we can enter your information into our system and initiate the pre-admission process. </p>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">Patients with mobile phones and text messaging capabilities will be enrolled in CareWire, our mobile message reminder service. This service will provide you with several important reminders prior to surgery including your arrival time and reminders about any special preparation that may be required in advance of your surgery.  </p>
								<p class="ident-bot-2">Patients who are unable to receive text messages will receive this information via telephone. If you are receiving reminders via telephone, our staff will ask you to provide a private phone number where we may leave information regarding your surgery. It is important that you check your voice mail messages the day prior to surgery as staff will communicate your arrival time and information any special preparation required. </p>

									<p><strong>Online Medical History &amp; Anesthesia Instructions</strong></p>
								</div>
								<p class="ident-bot-1">The EOSC nursing staff will contact you up to one week prior to your surgery to obtain a detailed medical and surgical history and provide pre-operative instructions. Patients or their care givers with internet access may choose to complete their medical history via a secure, on-line portal.  Although a nurse will still contact you with your pre-operative instructions, you will not need to provide detailed personal information regarding your medical and surgical history via telephone. </p>
								<p class="ident-bot-1">For more information on our Online Medical History tool or to start the process, please select the link below:</p>

								<p>If you are receiving any form of anesthesia, you will not be allowed to eat or drink after midnight the day prior to your surgery and you will need make arrangements to have someone drive you home after your surgery.  Taxi transportation for those patients accompanied by an adult escort is allowed.  Patients receiving anesthesia may not drive themselves home and must be accom-panied by a responsible adult in order to be discharged.  Concerns regarding transportation should be addressed directly with your surgeon.</p>
